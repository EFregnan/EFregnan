### Hi there 👋

I am PhD. student in Software Engineering, currently investigating how to support developers during code review 💻.

When I have some free time, I enjoy working on Open-Source projects. 

I am not anywhere close to being a senior developer, so any tips on how to program better are welcome! 😄

⚡ Favorite programming language: Java
